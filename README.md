# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Machine Learning based heart disease prediction system (Final Year Project - Work in progress)

Objective: The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of Coronary heart disease (CHD) or Ishemic Heart Disease (IHD) in a patient based on clinical parameters like age, cholesteraol, ECG results, and other medical parameters.

Dataset: 
 1. Total Record: 919
 2. Source: UCI Machine Learing Repository
 3. Target Variable: Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease (AHD)

Data Preprocessing:

The Dataset was preprocessed having the following tasks done:
 1. Handled Missng Values
 2. Encoded Categorical Variables
 3. Application of Feature scaling
 4. Train-Test Split performed

Models to be Implemented:
 1. Logistic Regression
 2. Random Forest
 3. KNN
 4. Decision Trees
 5. DNN
These models will be compared against various evaluation metrics to determine the most efficient algorithm.

Evaluation Metrics:
 1. Accuracy
 2. Precision
 3. Recall
 4. F1 score

Project Status: Work in progress = Model Implemetation ongoing.
